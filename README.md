Hi, I'm David!

I like to build stuff with code! I'm experienced with Python, Java, SQL, Swift/XCode, and Android Studio, and am dabbling in C, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

I graduated with a master's in computer science from Western Washington University in 2023.

My research: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10216577
