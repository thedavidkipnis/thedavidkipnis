Hi, I'm David!

I like to code - I'm experienced with Python, Java, TSQL, HTML/CSS, React/JavaScript, Swift/XCode, Android Studio, and C++.

Currently I work on building web applications (React, JavaScript) and database solutions (python, TSQL).

I graduated with a master's in computer science & artificial intelligence from Western Washington University in 2023.
